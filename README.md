## Why Livestack?


We're shaping a future where AI is more than just basic chatbots. They'll be key parts of our everyday life, tailored to our needs and daily situations. These AIs will interact with us directly, adapting as our day progresses, and they'll anticipate and fulfill our needs just in time. We believe this will enhance our lives and productivity by orders of magnitude.

Building these AI applications, however, is currently a complex task. Current popular AI frameworks aren't suited for real-time interaction and require extensive coding. Livestack aims to democratize this process, making it accessible not just for seasoned developers but also for those with basic coding skills.

Livestack is pioneering the vision of realtime AI by providing:

- A simple setup process for real-time AI apps.
- A real-time architecture for immediate user interaction responses.
- Full history tracking of all app activities for easy debugging and AI improvement.
- Ready-to-use AI components for tasks like live transcription and rapid image generation.

With Livestack, creating advanced AI applications is now easier and more accessible. It's not just for expert developers; even those with basic coding skills can get involved. This opens up more opportunities for everyone to build AI tools that can really make a difference in our daily lives.
