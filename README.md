## Why Livestack?


We believe the future of AI is not just about passive chatbots. It's about realtime AI applications that are always on, always listening, always ready to help.

At present, however, to implement such an AI project is still a complex task. Existing AI frameworks aren't well-suited for realtime interaction and often require extensive program design and coding. Once it's prototyped, there are still many steps to take to scale and deploy the application before it can be used by others.

Livestack, designed from the ground up, aims to democratize this process, making it approachable not just for seasoned developers but also for those with basic coding experience, and eventually, for everyone.

We look forward to seeing your next idea come to life with Livestack!

## Features

Livestack aims at providing:

- Native support for stream-based, realtime orchestration.
- Fullstack templates for both frontend and backend.
- Built-in queue system that automatically scales AI project to many machines.
- Graph-based workflows for better reasoning, visual inspection and debugging.
- Built-in data persistence of all in-app activities for easy debugging and future model tuning.
- (WIP) Common realtime AI components, patterns and guidelines for rapid prototyping, including:
  -  live speech transcription.
  -  live RAG workflow.
  -  realtime image generation.
- (WIP) Simple bootstrap process for new AI project.
