## Why Livestack?


We're shaping a future where AI is more than just basic chatbots. They'll be key parts of our everyday life, tailored to our needs and daily situations. These AIs will interact with us directly, adapting as our day progresses, and they'll anticipate and fulfill our needs just in time. This will greatly enhance our lives and productivity.

Livestack is pioneering this vision with:

- A simple setup process for real-time AI apps
- Full history tracking of all app activities for easy debugging and AI improvement.
- A real-time architecture for immediate user interaction responses.
