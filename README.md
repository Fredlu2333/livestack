## Why Livestack?

We believe the future of AI is not just about passive chatbots. It's about realtime AI applications that are always on, always listening, always ready to help.

At present, however, to implement such an AI project is still a complex task. Existing AI frameworks aren't well-suited for realtime interaction and often require extensive program design and coding. Once it's prototyped, there are still many steps to take to scale and deploy the application before it can be used by others.

Livestack, designed from the ground up, aims to democratize this process, making it approachable not just for seasoned developers but also for those with basic coding experience, and eventually, for everyone.

We look forward to seeing your next idea come to life with Livestack!

## Features

Livestack aims at providing:

- Native support for stream-based, realtime orchestration.
- Fullstack, end-to-end templates for both frontend and backend.
- Fully typed with zod and TypeScript support for better developer experience.
- Built-in queue system that automatically scales AI project to many machines.
- Graph-based workflows for better reasoning, visual inspection and debugging:
  - Multiple input/output streams for each job node (commonly encountered in modern AI components)
  - Intuitive workflow query language for easy inspection and debugging.
  - (WIP) Nested Workflows that allows for complex, multi-stage AI pipelines and component reusability.
- Built-in data persistence of all in-app activities for easy debugging and model tuning.
- (WIP) Common realtime AI components, patterns and guidelines for rapid prototyping, including:
  -  live speech transcription.
  -  live RAG workflow.
  -  realtime image generation.
- (WIP) Simple bootstrap process for new AI project.

## Design Principles

- Simplicity triumphs over complexity: reduce user's cognitive load as much as possible.
- Reasonable defaults to reduce burden of configuration.
- Minimal surprises and gotchas.
- Introduce new concepts and abstractions only when absolutely necessary.
- Battle-test a new feature, hurt it plenty, before releasing it.
