## Why Livestack?


We envision a future where AI is more than just passive, command-driven chatbots. They'll be key parts of our everyday life, tailored to our needs and daily situations. These AIs will interact with us directly, adapting as our day progresses, and they'll anticipate and fulfill our needs just in time. We believe this will enhance our lives and productivity by orders of magnitude.

Building these AI applications, however, is a complex task. Popular AI frameworks today aren't well-suited for real-time interaction and often require extensive coding. Livestack aims to democratize this process, making it accessible not just for seasoned developers but also for those with basic coding skills, and ultimately, for everyone.

Livestack provides:

- A simple setup process for real-time AI apps.
- A stream-based, reactive architecture for realtime user interaction responses.
- Full history tracking of all in-app activities for easy debugging and AI improvement.
- Ready-to-use AI components for rapid prototyping, such as:
  -  live speech transcription.
  -  live RAG ingestion and consumption.
  -  realtime image generation.
  -  etc.

We hope that Livestack will enable everyone to build AI tools that can really make a difference in our daily lives.
